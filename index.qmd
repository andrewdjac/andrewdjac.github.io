Welcome to my website! Here you can find information about some of the work I've completed so far in my Statistics career (and some other fun stuff). 

I'm a sixth-year PhD candidate in Statistics at [Virginia Polytechnic and State University](https://www.stat.vt.edu/) studying under the mentorship of [Bobby Gramacy](https://bobby.gramacy.com/). Before that I received my Bachelors ('18) and Masters ('20) degrees in Statistics from [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/) under the mentorship of [Alexander Volfovsky](https://volfovsky.github.io/). If I'm not doing research, I'm probably playing saxophone or going on a hike.
