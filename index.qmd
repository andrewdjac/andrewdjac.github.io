Welcome to my website! Here you can find information about some of the work I've completed so far in my Statistics career (and some other fun stuff). 

I'm a 5th-year PhD candidate in Statistics at [Virginia Polytechnic and State University](https://www.stat.vt.edu/). Before that I received my Bachelors ('18) and Masters ('20) degrees in Statistics from [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/). If I'm not doing research, I'm probably playing saxophone or going on a hike.
