Here you can find information about some of the work I’ve completed so far in my Statistics career (and some other fun stuff).\nI’m a sixth-year PhD candidate in Statistics at Virginia Polytechnic and State University studying under the mentorship of Bobby Gramacy. Before that I received my Bachelors (’18) and Masters (’20) degrees in Statistics from Duke University under the mentorship of Alexander Volfovsky. If I’m not doing research, I’m probably playing saxophone or going on a hike."
